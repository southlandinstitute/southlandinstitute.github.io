<h3>The Southland Institute
(for Critical, Durational, and Typographic Post-Studio Practices)</h3>
<p><em>website actively under construction</em></p>

The Southland Institute is an unaccredited post-graduate program and workshop built around a central curricular helix consisting of typography and critical art-making, which includes tools, processes, and discourses of these and their affiliated practices and histories. Participants' own self-directed practices will be supplemented by courses and theoretical discussions involving space, image, sound, time, theory, structure, situations, and language, and will spend their time in the program exploring the spaces, grey areas, interrelationships, and common boundaries between them, as well as their connection and relation to broader questions and circumstances.

These fundamental strands will be augmented by an evolving sequence of workshops and courses from a variety of disciplines, dependent on participants' backgrounds and interests, including but not limited to: design, art, moving image, economics, curation, landscape studies, writing, architecture, and sound. Connections will be explored via conversation, typographic exploration, and documentation in order to expand the spectrum of participants' contemporary studio and post-studio practices.


<h3>Objective(s):</h3>
The Southland Institute is a self-directed space for research, critique, conversation, cross-pollination, and expansion along and between continua of critical, durational, and typographic post-studio practices. Participants with integrative and transdisciplinary practices will be involved in interweaving discourses of 20th and 21st century art, media, graphic design, literary, and critical theory.

The program is intended to function as a stand-alone post-graduate educational environment, or as an add-on, in conjunction with a variety of other institutions in which participants may be currently or previously enrolled.

Participants will work primarily on self-directed projects under consultation with resident faculty and in conversation and collaboration with one another.

<h3>Conditions / Need:</h3>
The institute arises in response to a gap in dialog between discourses at existing institutions of all sizes. The aim of the institute is to activate and explore the points of contact between disciplines and media, and to create a space for extended development, exposure, and conversation that comes without a debt burden. 

<h3>Structure:</h3>
The program will be two years long, the academic year broken into 4 segments of 6 weeks each, two in the fall and two in the spring. Each Segment will consist of one primary course, each course taught by a different educator/practitioner. Some courses will be syllabus-based, others will be more self-directed and/or critique-based. There will also be a weekly typography workshop throughout the program. 

<h3>Administrative Aims:</h3>
To education from the field of investment and speculation.<sup>1</sup>
Offerering a reciprocally inflected art / design education, with a high level of interdisciplinary discourse, which expands the participants' practices, giving participants an experience and education roughly analogous to graduate level study. The institute is practice based and research-driven, but is not an academic research institution. 

<h3>Location:</h3>
Los Angeles, CA and southlandinstitute.org

<h3>Affordability and Transparency:</h3>
The institute begins its existence with little in the way of property and equipment. We believe that this enables an efficiency and a focus on education itself, at a cost that is several degrees of magnitude lower than many, if not all, current offerings. Los Angeles is a city of countless libraries and other accessible resources of which we encourage students to actively avail themselves.

<p>An additional structural aim of the institute is to operate on a transparent budget. The economic workings of the school, from tuition, to fund-raising, to faculty and adminstrative salaries, will be public and fully accessible.

<p>We are currently working out the budget, but at the outset, the aim is to have the program cost to students be under $3000 / year. 

<h3>Accreditation:</h3>
The Southland Institute is not accredited by any accrediting body, and therefore does not grant degrees.
